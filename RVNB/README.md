This project contains code for the project "Project 1: Rice Varieties using Naive Bayes (RVNB)". This is a part of the Machine Learning (CS60050) course offered at IIT Kharagpur in the Spring semester 2023.  The objective is to compare classify rice into varieties based on certain presumably independent characteristics using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The file ```ProblemStatement.pdf``` contains the precise problem statement.
### If you are running the experiment in Google Colab
 You must ensure '```Rice_Cammeo_Osmancik.csv```' (available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NCSuI98fnmiuY346ITpzm5mPpgHIteir/view?usp=share_link)) is in the Colab path. Upload it to your runtime using the folder icon on the left-hand side menu bar. Or, you may upload it to your Google Drive and [link Drive to Colab](https://towardsdatascience.com/different-ways-to-connect-google-drive-to-a-google-colab-notebook-pt-1-de03433d2f7a).
1. Download the `Group31_RVNB.ipynb` file to your local machine.
2. Open Google Colab in a browser.
3. Use the menu bar to navigate to File -> Open (alternatively, use the keybind Ctrl + O).
4. Select the "Upload" tab in the prompt and follow the instructions to upload `Group31_RVNB.ipynb`.
### If you are running the experiment on a Jupyter notebook server
The procedure is similar, but you will have to download the dataset to the same directory as the notebook.
1. Download the `Group31_RVNB.ipynb` file to the directory where the Jupyter notebook server is running from (or any other directory accessible to the client). 
2. Download the `Rice_Cammeo_Osmancik.csv` file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NCSuI98fnmiuY346ITpzm5mPpgHIteir/view?usp=share_link) to the same directory.
3. Locate the file in the Jupyter notebook client and open it.
4. Comment out the first (and only) line of cell 3. Or, delete it altogether.
### How to observe the results
1. On a fresh Jupyter kernel, run all the cells of the notebook.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the notebook. The salient results are displayed in the last few cells.
