# CS60050 Spring 2023
This repo contains code and reports for projects from the course on Machine Learning (CS60050) offered by the CSE department at IIT KGP. In particular, this is relevant to the [Spring 2023](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~aritrah/course/theory/ML/Spring2023/) iteration of the course, which was instructed by [Prof. Aritra Hazra](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~aritrah/).
There are three projects:
* ```RVNB``` (Rice Variety Classificaiton using Naive Bayes Classifier)
* ```HDSVM``` (Heart Disease Detection using Support Vector Machines)
* ```STHC-AS``` (K-means clustering vs. Single-Linkage Top-Down Agglomerative Clustering)

Each project has its own folder in the repository. Each folder is named as its constituent's corresponding ```project-code``` above. Each folder contains
* The problem statement
* A cogent report (```Group31_project-code.pdf``` or ```20EC30063_project-code.pdf```)
* The code required to reproduce the results in the report (```Group31_project-code.ipynb``` or ```20EC30063_project-code.ipynb```)
* A handy README file.

All credit to Prof. Hazra and his TAs for the problem statements.
Props to my batchmate [Anamitra Mukhopadhyay](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~anamitra.mukhopadhyay/) for being an equal contributor on the first two projects, RVNB and HDSVM. The third, STHC-AS, was posed as a solo project.
